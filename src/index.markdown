# 30 Seconds to CF?

* `set-pipeline` may take 30 seconds, but...

. . .

* It's more like 15 minutes from `0` to CF

Sorry ðŸ¤ 

# This is for you if:

You are ...

* developing a CF component
* developing on top of CF, e.g. a tool
* test-driving CF (different versions maybe?)

# Big Idea

`minikube : kube = this : CF`

# Why?

* Dev speed
  - quickly spin up a dev environment
  - fast onboarding of new team members
  - less fear
    => broke it? N.P.!

* Keep your laptop lightweight
  - no need to run CF locally
  - your version / patch level on someone else's hardware

* Cookie-cutter approach
  - Test environments by the dozen
  - Pet vs. cattle

* Vagrant philosophy
  - Repeatable dev environments
  - Ship the description, not the cluster
